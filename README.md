# Network Design

Design the network for a company... Assume that the following is true:
1.	There are two buildings next to each other: A factory and an office building. There is also a remote branch office located in another town.
2.	The main factory building has 3 floors; each floor needs at least 7 Ethernet ports to connect their devices. Use a router at each floor.
3.	The office building has 2 floors. Each floor has 2 offices, and each office needs at least 
2 Ethernet ports. Use a router at each floor.
4.	The branch itself has a modem, a router, and needs 4 Ethernet ports for the personnel working there.
5.	The company also has a leased line from one of the offices, to the branch office, connected via a router, a leased line and a modem. (for our simulation, connect the branch to the office via two routers with serial ports, and have the two “talk” to each other via PPP or another protocol of your liking.. you can even ignore the modems, and assume that the two routers are connected directly to each other via that leased line).
